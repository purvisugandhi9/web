<p class="para"> I am a 19 year old girl from a district of MP commonly known as city of Mughals <i>"Burhanpur".</i><br><br>

	so, I have never imagined that I will ever try coding in Real life , But this lockdown made me do so.
	<br> I am pursuing <i>Bachelor's Of Computer Science</i> from a college alffiated with DAVV.
<br>
<br>
	I love Travelling and exploring this beautifull nature,
	dancing and being a couch potato doing absolutely nothing(LOL).
<br>
<br>
    so, this lockdown I started learning HTML5 and then CCS3
    but never published a single page in reality.
<br>
<br>
    Then progate crossed my way , helped me learn GIT Commandline and publishing a webpage.
